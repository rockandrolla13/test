Incorporating CDX (Credit Default Swap Indices) transforms your strategy from a Funding/Liquidity arbitrage into a Capital Structure Arbitrage (specifically, the "Cash-CDS Basis").The core problem you must solve is that Credit Futures contain Interest Rate Risk (Duration), whereas CDX is pure Credit Spread Risk. You cannot trade them 1:1.Here is the technical breakdown of how to integrate CDX into your algo.1. The Fundamental EquationTo trade Credit Futures against CDX, you must construct a "Tri-Legged" trade to isolate the mispricing. You are essentially synthesizing a Credit Future using liquid derivatives:$$FairFuture \approx (TreasuryFuture_{Duration}) + (CDX_{Spread}) + (Basis)$$If the Credit Future trades significantly below this synthetic combination, the "Cash Basis" is negative (Bonds are cheaper than CDS).2. The Trade Structure: "The Cash-CDS Basis Arb"This is the standard trade when Cash bonds (Credit Futures) are "cheap" relative to CDS (CDX).Leg 1 (Long Risk): Buy Credit Future.Exposure: Long Duration + Long Credit Spread + Long Basis.Leg 2 (Hedge Rates): Sell Treasury Future (e.g., US, TY, FV).Action: Match the Key Rate Duration (KRD) of the Credit Future.Result: You have neutralized the interest rate risk. You are left with "Pure Cash Spread."Leg 3 (Hedge Credit): Buy Protection on CDX (Short CDX Risk).Action: Pay the fixed coupon (100bps for IG, 500bps for HY) to receive protection.Result: You have neutralized the generic market credit risk.The Alpha: You are now Long the "Basis".You profit if the Credit Future (Cash bond proxy) outperforms the CDX (Synthetic proxy).Historically, Cash bonds yield more than CDS (Negative Basis) due to the "funding cost" of holding physical bonds. Since Credit Futures are unfunded, this trade captures that "excess yield" without the heavy balance sheet drag.13. Critical Modeling Variables for CDX IntegrationA. The Hedge Ratio (DTS - Duration Times Spread)You cannot hedge based on notional value ($10M Future $\neq$ $10M CDX). You must hedge based on Spread Sensitivity.Formula: $HedgeRatio = \frac{CreditFuture_{CS01}}{CDX_{CS01}}$Note: $CS01$ (Credit Spread 01) measures the price change for a 1bp shift in spreads.2Algo Logic: Calculate the CS01 of the underlying Index daily. If the Index creates a "High Beta" basket, your CDX hedge ratio must increase > 1.0.B. The "Definition Gap" (Default vs. Devaluation)CDX Event: Triggers only on Credit Events (Failure to Pay, Bankruptcy, Restructuring). You get Par minus Recovery.Credit Future Event: Tracks the Index. If a bond is downgraded to junk ("Fallen Angel"), it exits the IG index at the month-end rebalance.The Risk: In a "slow bleed" scenario (downgrades without default), the Credit Future loses value (price drops), but the CDX might not pay out. Your hedge underperforms.Variable to Monitor: "Downgrade-to-Default Ratio." If the market expects a wave of downgrades (but not bankruptcies), reduce your CDX hedge size, as CDX won't capture the full mark-to-market loss of the Future.C. The "Basis Decompression" limitIn a liquidity crisis (e.g., March 2020):Cash Bonds (Futures): Sell off violently (Liquidity premium spikes).CDX: Widens, but less so (It's a synthetic macro tool, no funding required).Result: The Basis effectively "blows out."Algo Signal: Monitor Market Depth in the ETF. If ETF depth collapses, the "Basis" correlation breaks. Do not put on convergence trades (Long Future / Short CDX) when Volatility of Basis > 2 standard deviations.4. Practical Execution LogicStrategy: "Synthetic EFP" (Exchange for Physical)Calculate Implied Spread of Future:Take the Future Price $\rightarrow$ Strip out the Treasury Yield $\rightarrow$ Result is the Implied Cash Spread.Compare to CDX Spread:Is Implied Cash Spread > CDX Spread?Signal:If $(ImpliedCashSpread - CDXSpread) > Threshold$ (e.g., 20bps), Buy Future / Sell Treasury / Buy CDX Protection.You are locking in the "cheapness" of the cash market.Algo Nuance:CDX Roll: CDX rolls every 6 months (March/Sept).3 Liquidity shifts instantly to the "On-the-Run" series.Futures Roll: Credit Futures roll quarterly.4Mismatch: You have a calendar mismatch between your hedge (CDX) and your risk (Future). You must manage the "Roll Basis" risk when the CDX rolls but the Future hasn't.Summary of the "Tri-Legged" StackComponentRole in TradeRisk ManagedVariable to ModelCredit FutureLong Alpha TargetMarket BetaImplied Cash SpreadTreasury FutureShort HedgeInterest Rate DurationKRD (Key Rate Duration)CDX IndexBuy Protection HedgeGeneric Credit SpreadDTS (Duration Times Spread)
